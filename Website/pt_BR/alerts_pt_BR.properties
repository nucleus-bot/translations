#
# Abbreviations list is a set of words that can be abbreviated into a shorter form
#
## The list is used for alerts where the user may have specified an input such as a "Go live" message
## The message will be used for all alerts, incl. Discord or Twitter. If the user message is too long
## for short-form sites such as Twitter, the users message will be run through this list to try and shorten
## it until it will fit. Messages that are still too long will be truncated
#
## Abbreviations that are lower down the list take less priority than ones that are toward the top
## Words will only be replaced with the abbreviated form as long as the message is too long.
